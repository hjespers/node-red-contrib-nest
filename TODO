TODO
-map the "path" of streaming responses to the output topic so downstream nodes know what device or path the data came from
-test with more than one device (I just have one)
-test with smoke detector (I only own a thermostat)
-decide how to handle the EventSource keep alive messages in streaming mode (it sends a null message now)
-handle cleanup/disconnect of streaming connections properly (to avoid duplicate or stale connections)
-make a dedicated node for getting and setting ETA so that home automation can be programmed based on estimated time of arrival
-add support for nest camera
-fix labels so that "Client ID" should be "Product ID" and "Client Secret" should be "Product Secret"
